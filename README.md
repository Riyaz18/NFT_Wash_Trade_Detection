Detecting potential NFT wash trades using ensemble machine learning with synthetic data.
# ðŸ§  NFT Wash Trade Detection using Ensemble Machine Learning

This project focused on detecting **wash trading in NFT markets** using synthetic data and ensemble machine learning technique. It include feature engineering, handling data imbalance, model training, and saving the final model for deployment or further analysis

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Wash trading is a market manipulation tactic where the same entity acts as both buyer and seller to inflate asset value or volumes. This project simulates such behaviors using synthetic data and builds a predictive model to detect these pattern.

**Key Highlights:**
- Synthetic dataset simulating NFT transaction
- Extensive feature engineering based on address pattern, time bins, and price volatility
- Ensemble modeling using Soft Voting
- Evaluation with classification metrics, ROC-AUC,& PR-AUC
- Finally model and scaler saved for production use

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

A synthetic datasets of 10,000 NFT trades was generated with features such as:
- `price`, `gas_fee`, `trade_size`
- `buyer_address`, `seller_address`
- `token_id`, `seller_reputation`
- Time features (e.g., hour of day, transaction frequency)

Wash trade were simulate by introducing pattern like:
- Same buyer and seller
- Abnormal price/gas fee spikes
- Lower reputation for suspected sellers

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Approach

### Feature Engineering:
- TimeOfDay and frequency bins
- Address pair trade frequency
- Price volatility classification
- Polynomial interaction features

### Model Pipeline:
1. **StandardScaler** for normalization
2. **SMOTE** to address class imbalance
3. **Ensemble Model** using:
    - XGBoost (with hyperparameter tuning)
    - Random Forest
    - LightGBM

## âœ… Results

- **Accuracy**: 86%
- **F1-Score (wash trades)**: 0.69
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.92
- **PR AUC**: 0.74

ðŸ“Š Confusion Matrix:

[[1414 176]
[ 101 309]]

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas

- Apply the same logic to real NFT datasets (e.g., OpenSea, Ethereum logs)
- Explore network graph-based features (e.g., address graph)
- Deploy with Streamlit or FastAPI for live predictions
